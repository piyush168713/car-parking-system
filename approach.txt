Car Parking System:

- we initialize the value of amount and count is 0.
- we initially initialize the value of r, c, b is 0.
  r = rickshaw, c = car, b = bus

- we use while loop
- Taking the input from user of rickshaw, car and bus
  and using while loop and add the vehicles and increase the no. of vehicles and amount.

- then we show to user that how many vehicles are parked and amount.

- we can delete the whole record.
- If user enters any invalid number then it screen will popup the error messege of Invalid Number!!!
